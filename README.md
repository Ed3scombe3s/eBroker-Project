# eBroker-Project
This project is an algorithm that simulates a stock broker. It allows users to train their analysis skills and try to grow their portfolio.

### Getting Started
Before starting the program, make sure to run Requirements.ipynb to ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed.

Once that is done, run Main.py to start the program.

**Note:** Do not run All_Functions.py as it is for internal use only.

### File Structure
The program will create two new files: users.txt and users_portfolio.csv.

users.txt is used to save user information, such as username and password.
users_portfolio.csv is used to save each user's portfolio.

### User Information
Each user starts with a balance of 10,000 and is only allowed to have one open trade at a time.

If you need more money, you can go to users_portfolio.csv and change the amount next to your username
